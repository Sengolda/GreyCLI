# GreyCLI

- A simple cli tool to setup the [greybot template](https://github.com/sengolda/greybot.git)

### How to get started
- Install by doing:
```bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/Sengolda/GreyCLI#egg=greycli
```
- To run just do:
```bash
greybotsetup myawesomebot
```

Optionally if you are on `MacOS/Linux` you can install `uvloop` to get a faster asyncio event loop
```bash
pip install -U uvloop
```

**NOTE:** There is currently no Windows support only `MacOS/Linux`
